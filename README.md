# Hindsight Goal Ranking

PyTorch implementation of [Hindsight Goal Ranking on Replay Buffer for Sparse Reward Environment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9391700)

## Idea
- Multi-goal reinforcement learning in sparse continuous domains (aka Robotics)
- Enhance sample efficiency through advanced sampling techniques that prioritize episodes and goals
